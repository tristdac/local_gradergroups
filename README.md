# Moodle local gradergroups #

A small local plugin to illustrate the use of gradergroups as
documented here
https://docs.moodle.org/dev/gradergroups
This purely adds a header and text entry field into the editing form
of the assignment module.
See this plugin for an example of callback implementation.
